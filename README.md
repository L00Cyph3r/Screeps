# Howdy
This is my own attempt of building a modular library/script for the geeky game Screeps.  
To use this script follow the instructions.  
If you want to alter this, [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)... Saves a lot of time...

# Install instructions
- ### Before you start
  - Make sure your spawn is called `Spawn1`
  - Set your room-name in memory. [Documentation](docs/config.md#config-rooms)
  - You don't need any creeps to start with, this script runs from the very start of a world.

- ###  Copy the stuff
Copy all the contents to your local folder.  
Note that the folder `ScreepsAutocomplete` is only needed if you want autocomplete to work for some editors. (See https://github.com/Garethp/ScreepsAutocomplete/ for more info)

# More docs
  - #### [Creeps](docs/creeps.md) - Roles, naming and stuff

  - #### [Config](docs/config.md) - Settings you can change
